    <h1>Everyone</h1>
    <p>Everyone learns in different ways and POWS is a resource for teachers to help them teach in different ways.</p>
    <p>Lots of research has been done into the different ways people learn and these have been called learning styles.</p>

    <h1>Learning Styles</h1>
    <p>Most people like to learn using a combination of learning styles, to illustrate this I'm going to introduce you to four learners.</p>

            <p>Tanu likes to take notes, she finds this helps her to remember what someone has said, sometimes she makes mind maps and other times she writes in lists.</p>
            <p>If Tanu has a lot of information to remember she finds it easier to associate the information as part of a journey so she can visualise it all in her minds eye. </p>

    <h1>Learning Theories</h1>
    <p>Learning Theories are the academic research that has lead to the definition of learning styles.</p>
    <section id="VAK" class="typeC inner">
        <h1>VAK</h1>
        <p>VAK stands for: Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic.</p>
        <p>These are the 3 most common ways that people learn. The model was developed in the 1920's by psychologists to classify how people learn assigning a person to one of these categories.</p>
        <p>A spin of from VAK was VARK which added in Reading/Writing.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="ELPS" class="typeD inner">
        <h1>ELPS</h1>
        <p>ELPS stands for: Experience (with objects), Language (describe an experience), Pictures and Symbols. </p>
        <p>The model was developed in the 1980's to explain how to teach mathematics. As mathematics was seen to be a hard subject for some children to grasp due to its abstract nature.</p>
    <p>ELPS builds upon the idea that you need to show the same information in lots of different ways in order for it to be understood.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="CPA" class="typeE inner">
        <h1>CPA</h1>
        <p>CPA stands for: Concrete, Pictorial and Abstract. </p>
        <p>This model developed by J.Bruner explains that in order to understand an abstract concept you first have to introduced to it as something concrete i.e. a real world example. </p>
        <p>Once you understand the real version you can describe the information through pictures, one step towards abstraction, and then through symbols.</p>
        <p>For example, to introduce the concept of the number 10 I would show you ten physical objects (Concrete), then draw you 10 circles (Pictorial), and then right the digits 1 and 0 to represent the number 10 (Abstract). </p>
    </section>
    <section id="cognitive-style-dimension" class="typeF inner">
        <h1>Cognitive Style Dimension</h1>
        <p>Explains how people are on a Wholist/Analytic scale and an Imager/Verbaliser scale.</p>
        <p>This model was introduced by Riding and Ranger in 1998 and explores how people process information: in parts (Analyst) or wholes (Wholist) and how they represent information, visually (Imager) or verbally (Verbaliser).</p>
        <p>A Wholistic Imager is likely to want to see the big picture in a visual way before looking into the details.</p>
